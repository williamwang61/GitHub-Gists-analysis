\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

GitHub is a popular source code hosting site which serves as a collaborative coding platform. The many features of GitHub have greatly facilitated developers' collaboration, communication, and coordination. One of these features is Gists, which is defined as ``a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others''. This report presents a three-part study which explores how users are using Gists. The first part is a quantitative analysis against the metadata of 562,993 GitHub users and 618,393 Gists, as well as the 793,891 files contained in those Gists. The second part investigates the actual Gist content by manually labeling 400 randomly selected Gists. The third part of the study investigates users' comments about how they used Gists from the searched results of Websites and Twitter postings. Our study shows that Gists are used by a small portion of GitHub users, and those that use them typically only have a few Gists. We found that Gists are usually small snippets of source code and composed of a single file. However, Gists serve a wide variety of uses, from saving snippets of code or notes, sharing files, to drafting their writings.

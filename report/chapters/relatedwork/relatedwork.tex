\section{Version Control History and GitHub}

%CVCS
Version Control Systems (VCS) were developed to record changes to a file or set of files over time so that a specific version can be recalled later. \cite{chacon2009pro} The traditional Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) require developers to commit a change to a central repository, merge and resolve the conflicts. This mechanism leads to the downside where the entire history of the project lies in the central database, and if the central database becomes corrupted, all the history data would be lost. \cite{chacon2009pro}\cite{5071408} 

%DVCS
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) relaxed the requirement of CVCSs to have a central, master repository. In a DVCS, each developer owns ``first-class access'' to the project repository so they can access the entire history data of the repository.\cite{5071408}. DVCS has the potential to ``make releasing, developing, and coordinating large software projects much less rigid than its exclusively centralized predecessor''.\cite{6607694}

%Git
Among all these DVCSs, Git has gained the most momentum. It began in 2005 as a revision management system used for coordinating the Linux kernel's development. Over the years, Git has evolved by ``leaps and bounds'' due to its functionality, portability, efficiency, and rich third-party adoption.\cite{6188603}

%Applications based on Git
Using Git as a back end to host open source projects, many Web-based applications enhanced project management functionality by adding rich user-friendly interfaces, which provide a convenient way for developers to set up repositories, clone existing projects and commit their contributions.\cite{6188603} These applications also lay more emphasis on the social aspect of software engineering. 

%GitHub
Among all these applications, GitHub is the most popular one with more than 12.2 million users\footnote{\url{https://github.com/about/press}}. GitHub not only allows users to \textit{star}\footnote{\url{https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/}} or \textit{watch}\footnote{\url{https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/}} repositories to keep track of projects they find interesting, but also allows users to follow other users to see what other people are working on and who they are connecting with. GitHub also supports team management using the \textit{organizations} feature, projects discovery using \textit{explore} feature, bugs tracing using \textit{issues}, etc.\footnote{\url{https://help.github.com/articles/be-social}} By integrating these social features into the version control system, the communication and coordination among developers is greatly enhanced.\cite{6357175}

\section{Recent Research on GitHub}
GitHub introduces a new open source environment that has given rise to research from many different angles. GitHub is a huge data pool that contains not only numerous projects but also developers' profiles and developers' activities such as their contributions to projects and their interactions with other developers. More and more researchers have jumped into this data pool, trying to discover some interesting patterns or good stories in either software engineering or social networking. 

Some researchers have been working on helping employers find technical experts by analyzing into the developers' profile and their activities.\cite{6336698}\cite{Marlow:2013:ATS:2441776.2441794}\cite{Venkataramani:2013:DTE:2487788.2487832}\cite{6671295} Others have focused on the source code in project repositories. For example, Bissyande et al. (2013) took advantage of the rich data on GitHub by examining the ``popularity'', ``interoperability'', and ``impact'' of various programming languages measured in different ways, such as lines of code, development teams, issues, etc.\cite{6649842} There are also some researchers who tried to discover patterns in developers' collaboration and interaction, such as how developers assess each other and find proper collaborators\cite{Majumder:2012:CTF:2339530.2339690}\cite{Marlow:2013:IFO:2441776.2441792}\cite{Singer:2013:MAS:2441776.2441791}, the herding phenomena on GitHub\cite{Choi:2013:HOS:2441955.2441989}, the relation between developers' behavior on GitHub and other Q\&A websites like StackOverflow\footnote{\url{http://www.stackoverflow.com/}}\cite{6693332}, etc.

However, no scientific study that focused on GitHub Gists have been found.

\section{GitHub Gists}

\subsection{Related Tools}
There are some other snippets management tools similar to GitHub Gists such as \textit{pastebin}\footnote{\url{http://pastebin.com/}}, \textit{snipt}\footnote{\url{https://snipt.net/}}, \textit{codepen}\footnote{\url{http://codepen.io/}}, \textit{dabblet}\footnote{\url{http://dabblet.com/}}, etc. However, GitHub Gists is the only one that manages snippets using version control. Over these years, the features of GitHub Gists are being improved and updated to be more user friendly\footnote{\url{https://github.com/blog/1837-change-the-visibility-of-your-gists}} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/blog/1850-gist-design-update}}.

\subsection{The Features of Gists}

Gists are expected to be small snippets of code or text that utilize the version control tool Git for creation and management. Wikipedia provides a good explanation of the benefits of Gists as follows\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\#Gist}}: 

\textsl{``Gist builds upon that idea by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each `gist' is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they and be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so pastes can become more like mini-projects.''}

In addition, GitHub also provides a powerful Web-based editor to create or modify Gists, which makes it possible to work on Gists without Git. It also supports comments on Gists and provides a Web service that makes Gists embeddable in a Web page. All these features make Gists very flexible, functional and user friendly, helping users better manage their gists and share them.

\section{Research Questions}

There are two main research questions to be addressed in this study.  
\begin{itemize}

  \item {\bf RQ1. What do Gists look like?}
   
  To get a whole picture of what Gists are like, we investigated the metadata and contents of Gists, and tried to answer this question using statistical results.


  \item {\bf RQ2. How are Gists being used?}

  We used Google to search Web pages and tweets on Twitter for people's description about how they used Gists. We combined these information with the results of the previous question to answer this research question.

\end{itemize}

Our methodology was a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The study involved three main parts with the first two parts to answer {\bf RQ1} and the third to answer {\bf RQ2}:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item A quantitative analysis of the metadata and contents of sampled Gists that were created by a large sample of GitHub users.

  \item A qualitative analysis of a small sample of Gists. The Gists files were manually inspected to infer the purpose of each Gist.

  \item A qualitative analysis of searched results of people's description about how they used Gists. 
\end{enumerate}
